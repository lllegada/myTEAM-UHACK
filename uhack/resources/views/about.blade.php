    Good day, every<strike>juan</strike>one.
     I am <b>Shebna Rose Fabilloren</b>, born five days before Christmas eve of the year 1997. Currently, I am studying <u>Computer Science</u> at <tt>University of the Philippines Visayas</tt>(<acronym>UPV</acronym>) which is located exactly <em><big>10°38'59.3"N 122°13'40.3"E</big></em>. Aside from being a <mark>diligent student</mark>, I enjoy utilizing my time on other activites such as sleeping, eating and having enough sanity to handle this semester until I graduate and get a legit job.
     Let me share my favorite quote to you:
     </p>`      `                                                               
     <pre>
        <q>Not having heard something is not as good as having heard it;
         having heard it is not as good as having seen it;
         having seen it is not as good as knowing it; 
         knowing it is not as good as putting it into practice. </q>
